                <p>StoryTeller is a grimoire of of TTRPG campaigns. “But what’s a TTRPG ?” you might ask, well here’s a whole paragraph we took from wikipedia: <br>
                    <div class="isi">
                    A tabletop role-playing game (typically abbreviated as TRPG or TTRPG), also known as a pen-and-pa
                    per role-playing game, is a form of role-playing game (RPG) in which the participants describe their 
                    characters' actions through speech. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on 
                    their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a set formal system of rules and 
                    guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction 
                    and outcome of the game.
                    </div> 
                    The terms pen-and-paper and tabletop are generally only used to distinguish this format of RPG from 
                    other formats, since neither pen and paper nor a table are strictly necessary.
